## About the project

This is a userscript, used with TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey, used to avoid overlapping replies on WordPress.org.

The script provides a small bar, showing you what other script uers are viewing (or typing) in a given topic.

This is done to avoid overlapping replies, which can be confusing to end users, and in some cases come off as noisy or spammy.
